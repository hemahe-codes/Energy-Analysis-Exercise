For the Selection.py script to work, we have to take into account the following:
  1. This script only works with two chain (A and B) proteins.
  2. The number of the residues that we want to select must be saved in a text file. There must be a text file for residues in chain A and another text file for residues in chain B. The name of the files must be: chainA_'structure name'.txt ,      chainB_'structure name'.txt. Example of structure name: 6axg
